 Congratulations! you have been hired as a Chief Data Scientist by “QuickMoney”, 
 a fast growing Hedge fund. They rely on automated systems to carry out trades 
 in the stock market at inter-day frequencies. They wish to create a machine 
 learning-based strategy for predicting the movement in stock prices.

  They ask you to create a trading strategy to maximize their profits in the 
 stock market. Stock markets are known to have high degree of unpredictability, 
 but you have an opportunity to beat the odds and create a system which will 
 outperform others.

   The task for this challenge is to predict whether the price for a particular 
 stock at the tomorrow’s market close will be higher(1) or lower(0) compared to 
 the price at today’s market close.
